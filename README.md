### Reg lounge thing

Currently using [JavaScript Standard Style ](http://standardjs.com/rules.html) for consistency, but we can remove that if it's not preferable.

### usage
* Check out this project
* Install global dependencies via npm
```bash
npm install webpack -g
```
* Install project dependencies `npm install`
* Run `npm run build && npm start`
* You can use `npm run watch` in another terminal to build as you make changes
